### Authentication
The application uses JWT tokens for authentication. To interact with the secured endpoints, follow these steps:

#### Obtain a Token:

- Make a GET request to /auth/token to receive a JWT token.
  Example:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/auth/token
```
### Use the Token:

Include the token in the Authorization header of your requests:
```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
```
### Docker Setup

- Set Environment Variables:

- Ensure the JWT_SECRET is configured in your environment. You can do this in a .env file:

```makefile
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```
- Build the Docker Image:

- Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image:

```bash
Copiar c√≥digo
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env currency-exchange-api
```
